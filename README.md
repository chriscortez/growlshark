growlshark
==========

A Growl-like notification system for Grooveshark

Requirements:
Max OS X 10.8 or later

Safari

This code uses the notification center introduced in Mac OS X 10.8 and
Safari's ability to allow webpages to interface with this. It mimics
Growl's ability to discreetly show you the current song being played as it starts
playing.

To use:
Open a Grooveshark window in Safari and copy the line in growlshark.js into the browser bar. You might have to check "Allow JavaScript from Smart Search Field" under the Develop menu.

If an alert box appears asking for permission to use the notification
center, allow it.


That's it! You will see new songs pop up in the notification center.
